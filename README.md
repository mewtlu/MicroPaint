# MicroPaint
A very lightweight, minimal online image editor library based significantly on [miniPaint](https://github.com/viliusle/miniPaint).

## Intention
This was originally created for use in another project so only contains the features specifically required by that project, however my plans for the future of the project are to allow configuration of which tools, effects, panes, etc. are visible.

## Build instructions
- Build for development: `npm run dev`
- Build for production: `npm run build`
